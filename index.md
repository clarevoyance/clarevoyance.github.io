## My Story
Back in 2014, I saw the need to pivot my career upon learning about Generative Adversarial Networks. This took me on a wild journey as I transited first by working in the areas of search engine optimization, and eventually landed a role as a technical editor for a Polish IT startup. These two roles allowed me to build my understanding in the software development lifecycle, agile methodologies, as well as digital marketing. I eventually transited into the role of a digital consultant in 2018 where my projects were focused on the development of digital transformation programs. 

I am currently a Masters candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology and will begin my new role as an artificial intelligence engineer at the end of 2021.
